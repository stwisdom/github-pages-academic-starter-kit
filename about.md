I am currently a senior research scientist at [Affectiva](https://www.affectiva.com) in Boston, MA.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I worked in the Interactive Systems Design Lab (ISDL), advised by [Les Atlas](https://www.ee.washington.edu/people/les-atlas/) and [James Pitton](http://apl.uw.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Pitton&first_name=James). My dissertation work was on how to combine interpretable statistical models of audio and other sequential data with deep learning. During my Ph.D., I also interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) and with the [Speech & Audio group at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL)](http://www.merl.com/research/speech-audio).
